# Introduction 
  Self-Journal is a tool in which users can fill out daily questionairs about their day to day experiences. We usually talk about health in terms of our physical body, but very rarely do we talk about our mental health. Journaling has become increasinginly popular over the years with the rise of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, self doubt, and negative self image due to the increase of over stimulation of technology via social media, video games, and TV. Self-Journal is as step in the right direction. Studies have shown that writing down how you're feeling and your expereinces increases dopamine levels while also decreasing negative emotions. This also allows you to "dump" out all your burdening mental issues and give a sense of relief. Simply writing your thoughts down should only take about 5 minutes of your time each day. Your mental health will thank you!
