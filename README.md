# Introduction 
  Self-Journal is a tool in which users can fill out our simple questionnaire about their day to day experiences and feelings. We usually talk about health in terms of our physical body, but very rarely do we talk about our mental health. 
  
  Journaling has become increasingly popular over the years due to the rise of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, self doubt, and negative self image due to the over stimulation of technology via social media, video games, and TV. Self-Journal is as step in the right direction. Studies have shown that writing down how you are feeling and your personal expereinces increases seratonin while also decreasing negative emotions. This also allows you to "dump" out your burdening mental load and give your mind a sense of relief. 
  
  Simply writing your thoughts down should only take about 5 minutes of your time each day. Your mental health will thank you!
